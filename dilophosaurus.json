    "description": "Dilophosaurus was a fast-moving meat-eating dinosaur.  A kink in its upper jaw may mean that it ate a certain kind of food, or attacked by gripping and holding on to prey - modern crocodiles have a similar kink. The pair of thin bony crests on its head may have been for display."
